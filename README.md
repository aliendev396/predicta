# PREDICTA Platform

PREDICTA — Instant Virtuals Outcome Engine

Build a production-quality Progressive Web App called PREDICTA.

PREDICTA is a modern AI-powered instant virtual sports outcome exposure engine. Users can upload screenshots containing structured visual information, and the system uses AI image analysis to extract and organize information into a clear, easy-to-understand report.

The product must feel like a premium technology platform.

22. ROW LEVEL SECURITY

Implement strict Supabase RLS.

Members can only read their own:

Profile

Payments

Subscription

Analyses

Notifications

Partners can only access:

Their own partner profile

Their own referrals

Their own commissions

Their own statistics

Admins can access administrative records through secure authorization.

Never rely solely on frontend route protection.

Never expose Supabase service-role credentials in the browser.

23. FILE STORAGE

Create a private Supabase Storage bucket for uploaded images.

Do not make uploaded screenshots publicly accessible by default.

Use secure access policies.

Validate:

File type

File size

Authenticated user

Ownership

Do not trust the file extension alone.

24. PWA

Configure the application as a Progressive Web App.

Include:

Manifest

App icon

Splash screen

Install prompt

Responsive layout

Offline-friendly shell

Mobile navigation

Use the Virtu-IQ symbol as the primary PWA icon.

Use the full logo inside the application where space allows.

25. RESPONSIVE DESIGN

Desktop:

Sidebar + content.

Tablet:

Compact sidebar.

Mobile:

Bottom navigation or compact drawer.

Mobile navigation should prioritize:

Dashboard
Analyze
History
Account

The symbol logo should be used in the mobile header.

26. COMPONENT SYSTEM

Create reusable components:

Button
Input
Select
Modal
Dialog
Card
Badge
Table
Avatar
Dropdown
Toast
Sidebar
Navbar
FileUploader
ProgressIndicator
EmptyState
LoadingState
ErrorState
ConfirmationDialog
StatsCard

Maintain consistent spacing and typography.

27. EMPTY STATES

Every section should have a useful empty state.

Example:

"No analyses yet."

Supporting text:

"Upload your first screenshot to begin your AI analysis."

Button:

"Analyze Screenshot"

28. ERROR HANDLING

Never show raw technical errors.

Use friendly messages.

Examples:

"Something went wrong. Please try again."

"Your image could not be processed. Please upload a clearer image."

"Your session has expired. Please log in again."

29. SECURITY

Implement:

Supabase Auth

RLS

Secure storage

Server-side validation

Input validation

Role-based authorization

Audit logging

Rate limiting where appropriate

Secure environment variables

No secret keys in frontend code

Never place private API keys in React components.

Never trust:

User-submitted prices

User-submitted roles

User-submitted commission percentages

Frontend payment status

Frontend credit balances

All important values must be validated server-side.

30. UI DETAILS

Use subtle animations:

Page transitions

Button hover

Card hover

Upload progress

Loading skeletons

Modal transitions

Keep animations fast and professional.

Buttons should have clear loading states.

Disable buttons while important operations are processing.

31. ACCESSIBILITY

Implement:

Proper labels

Keyboard navigation

Focus states

Accessible dialogs

Good contrast

Semantic HTML

Screen-reader-friendly controls

Large enough mobile touch targets

32. FINAL EXPERIENCE

The application should feel similar in quality to a premium modern SaaS product.

The user should immediately understand:

What Virtu-IQ does.

How to create an account.

How to purchase analysis credits.

How to upload an image.

How to view their AI analysis.

How many credits remain.

The admin should immediately understand:

Revenue

Members

Pending payments

Partners

Referrals

Commissions

Analysis activity

Partners should immediately understand:

Their referral link

Registrations

Revenue generated

Commission percentage

Commission earned

33. IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION RULE

Do not create a fake/demo-only application.

Build the UI and architecture so it is ready to connect to Supabase.

Use realistic loading, error, empty, success, and pending states.

Do not hard-code dashboard statistics.

Do not hard-code user information.

Do not hard-code payment statuses.

Do not hard-code partner statistics.

All dynamic information must come from the database.

34. BUILD ORDER

Implement in this order:

Brand/design system

Landing page

Authentication

Supabase database

Member dashboard

Package/subscription interface

Payment workflow

Screenshot upload

AI analysis workflow

Analysis history

Admin dashboard

Payment verification

Partner system

Commission system

Notifications

Audit logs

PWA functionality

Responsive optimization

Security/RLS

Final UI polish

Before moving between major sections, ensure the previous section works correctly.

Start by creating the complete design system and landing page using the supplied Virtu-IQ logo assets, then progressively build the authenticated application.

The finished product should look like a cohesive, polished product from one company—not a collection of separate dashboard templates.
